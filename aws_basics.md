<h2>AWS Basics</h2>

<h3>Terminology</h3>

**High availability**: Refers to a system or component that is continuously operational for a desirably long length of time. Availability can be measured relative to "100% operational" or "never failing." On AWS this s implemented by distributing your infrastructure across different availability zones. Files, services and systems will be always available if implemented according to HA best practices.

**Scalability**: The ability for a cloud infrastructure to grow according to demand of service. More traffic = More Instances. Guarantees that no matter the amount of traffic, the clients are always gonna be able to use the services with no impact on performance or availability.

**Elasticity**: The ability for a cloud infrastructure to shrink quickly as the demand of a service goes lower. Less traffic = Less instances. Guarantees that if traffic goes down, there are no unused instances, thus reducing costs.

**Fault Tolerance**: Fault tolerance is the property that enables a system to continue operating properly in the event of the failure of (or one or more faults within) some of its components. On AWS this is implemented by replacing faulty instances with new ones automatically.
